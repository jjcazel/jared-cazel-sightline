# Interview Task: Order Data Dashboard

**Time Limit: ≈ 1-2 hours of hands-on coding**

## Overview

You'll build a data visualization dashboard using realistic order data. We've provided the complete data infrastructure (hooks → actions → data layer) - your focus is on the UI and data transformation layer.

**What we're evaluating:**

- React + TypeScript proficiency
- UI/UX judgment for making data actionable
- Code organization and reusability
- Prioritization under time constraints

## Time-Boxing & Development Approach

We respect your time. Please **stop after ≈ 2 hours of hands-on coding**. It is expected that after 1-2 hours there will be features you want to polish or optimizations you want to make. That is **perfectly OK** – document these thoughts in your summary at the end.

### Recommended Approach:

- **Leverage AI development tools heavily** (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- Focus on core functionality first, polish later
- Time-box decisions (don't spend 30 minutes picking a chart library)

### Acceptable Shortcuts:

- Use pre-built component libraries rather than building from scratch
- Use any charting library you're comfortable with
- Focus on the happy path, skip edge case handling
- Basic styling is fine - functional > beautiful

## The Data

You're working with **Orders** and **OrderLineItems**:

```typescript
Order {
  orderNumber: string;
  storeName: string;
  orderDate: Date;
  lineItems: OrderLineItem[];
}

OrderLineItem {
  orderNumber: string;
  itemNumber: string;
  supplierName: string;
  quantity: number;
  unitPrice: number;
  totalPrice: number; // totalPrice = unitPrice * quantity
}
```

Full type definitions: [`types/order.ts`](types/order.ts)

The app generates deterministic fake data:

- 200 unique items
- 10 stores
- 15 suppliers
- Some logic for order frequencies and pricing

## Core Requirements (Pick Your Battles!)

**You should complete at least 2 of the following 3:**

### 1. Data Table

Display orders in a sortable table with key columns:

- Order Number
- Store Name
- Order Date
- Total Amount
- Number of Line Items

**Why we care:** Can you present tabular data clearly? Do you handle sorting and display well?

### 2. Filtering

Add at least **one** working filter:

- Store Name filter (dropdown or multi-select)
- OR Supplier Name filter (from line items)

**Why we care:** Can you work with nested data structures? How do you handle state?

### 3. Visualization

Create **one** meaningful chart showing:

- Daily order totals over the date range
- OR orders by store
- OR another metric you find interesting

**Why we care:** Can you transform data for visualization? How do you choose what to show?

## Evaluation Criteria

| What We're Looking For | What We Care About                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Functionality** | At least 2 of the 3 requirements work; data displays correctly; interactions function as expected |
| **Code Quality**       | Clean React patterns; reusable components; proper TypeScript usage; reasonable state management   |
| **UI/UX**              | Intuitive interface; clear data presentation; responsive design\*; visual feedback                |
| **Time Management**    | Smart prioritization; documented TODOs; realistic scope for 1-2 hours                             |

\* Responsive within typical desktop browser sizes - no need for full mobile support

### Don't Worry About:

❌ Perfect styling (functional > beautiful)  
❌ Edge cases (focus on happy path)  
❌ Tests (we know you're time-constrained)  
❌ Performance optimization (unless obvious)

## Getting Started

The infrastructure is ready:

```typescript
// Fetch orders for a date range
const { data: orders, isLoading } = useOrders(startDate, endDate);

// Helper functions available in actions
getStoreNames(); // All store names
getSupplierNames(); // All supplier names
getItemNumbers(); // All item numbers
```

**Your code goes in:**

- New components in `components/` (create subdirectories as needed)
- Replace the demo content in `app/page.tsx`

## Libraries

Feel free to install any libraries you're comfortable with:

- **Tables:** TanStack Table, AG Grid, or build your own
- **Charts:** Recharts, Chart.js, Victory, D3, Nivo
- **UI:** Any component library or stick with Tailwind CSS

## Deliverables

Submit your solution as a **Git repository** (GitHub link preferred) or **zip file** containing:

1. **Working code** that runs with `npm run dev`
2. **Brief comments** on complex logic (inline or in code)
3. **A short summary** (add to the bottom of this file):
   - What you built (which core features you chose)
   - Key decisions you made
   - What you'd add with more time

## Tips

- **Start simple** - Get one thing working well, then add more
- **Use the console** - The demo page logs all data, check the structure
- **Partial > perfect** - A working table beats an unfinished table + broken chart
- **Document trade-offs** - If you skip something, explain why in your summary
- **Ask questions** - If something is unclear, reach out!

## Questions?

If something is unclear:

- Check the browser console for data examples
- Review [`types/order.ts`](types/order.ts) for the data structure
- Look at the existing demo in [`app/page.tsx`](app/page.tsx)
- Email us - this is meant to be a straightforward exercise

## Your Summary

What I built

- A server-rendered dashboard page that composes static header content with client-only data components.
- A sortable, filterable orders table using Material React Table, plus summary stats and loading skeletons.

Key decisions

- Chose Material React Table to avoid wiring a headless TanStack table to UI components while still getting built-in sorting and filtering suited for larger datasets.
- Kept the main page as a server component to reduce client bundle size, and moved interactive logic into dedicated client components.
- Used focused loading states so static UI renders immediately while the table/data loads.
- Added comprehensive TSDoc comments and kept styling in Tailwind to match existing conventions.

What I would add with more time

- Custom pagination and filter UI for a more refined UX.
- Extract column definitions into a separate module for reuse and clarity.
- Optionally add SCSS modules for more structured styling if the project moved away from Tailwind.

Notes

- I was able to get a working, polished MVP with Copilot in about 30 minutes.
- The current setup should remain performant even for tens of thousands of rows, but I would profile real data.

Thanks for the opportunity and I appreciate any feedback!
